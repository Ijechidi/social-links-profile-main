### Links

- Live Site URL: [live site  ](https://ijechidi.github.io/social-links-profile-main/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) - Example of styles
- [Styled Components](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-component-classes) - For styling component


### What I learned

##### Utility-First Approach: Tailwind CSS emphasizes using small, single-purpose utility classes to construct UI components directly in  HTML markup
##### Customizable: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable. We can extend and configure the framework to fit the project's needs through a configuration file
##### Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS includes responsive utility classes, enabling easy implementation of responsive designs without additional CSS media queries


### Continued development

Still in the process of knowing of [components](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-component-classes)


### Useful resources

- [Components in tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-component-classes) - This helped me in developping the card. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand in details this css framework. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
